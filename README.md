MeagerTesting.py - a starting point or template for implementing models of treatment effects from A/B tests.


Inspired by Rachel Meager's paper on the metaanalysis of microcredit expansions (see the refs folder). 
The model in ./src/MeagerTesting.py extends the original model to jointly estimate effects across all outcomes, times and treatments.

Depends on pytorch and pyro
