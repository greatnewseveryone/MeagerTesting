MeagerTesting.py - a starting point or template for implementing models of treatment effects from A/B tests.


Inspired by Rachel Meager's paper on the metaanalysis of microcredit expansions in the refs folder. 
The model in ./src/MeagerTesting.py extends the original model to also include correlations across time and outcomes, in addition to the correlations across treatments.

Depends on pytorch and pyro
